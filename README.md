**#SLEEP DETECTOR APP**

**Special Instructions :**
While using this app , user must enable the location and camera permission by going in the app info of sleep detector of your mobile setting , just click on permissions and then allow permissions to camera and location . It is a one time thing.

**IDEA :**
This is the season where people feel drowsy and sleepy and just want to hibernate! So, it would be dangerous if the person falls asleep while driving and there are high chances of car accidents! To keep encourage road safety, I have made an app that alerts the driver when they feel sleepy and can also locate nearby places like cafe,hospital,hotel etc to rest , one can also use this app in picture to picture mode(i.e, floating window).

**What it does? :**
Closing eyes, blinking, yawning are some of the symptoms of feeling Sleepy. Considering this, I have built an app, Sleep Detector that rings the alarm when the driver shows any of these symptoms and pops up a message so that user can find nearby place to rest. This app accesses the camera, detects the blinking eyes, yawns, closed eyes using computer vision and maps using maps api and then alerts the driver when they are sleepy.

**How I built it :**
I built this app on Android Studio using Java and XML. I used computer vision (Google Vision Library) to detect closed eyes and yawns and (google maps Api)to locate nearby and current location in our app. I also included Splash-Screen, About Us, Facts page activities, picture in picture mode on main page(i.e,face recognisation).

**Challenges I ran into :**
This is my first ever android application(project) learning anroid development,learning how to use android studio,Coming up with the UI and making this app within the time constraints was a bit challenging. I tried to use the OpenCV library at the beginning but I struggled to incorporate it with the app. So, I searched for alternatives and used the Google Vision Library. Implementing maps was bit struggling somehow I managed to do that after watching several tutorials , I implement maps using maps api.

**What I learned :**
I learn the latest technology of android development and how to use android studio and also explored the Google Vision Library , maps library. I learnt how to balance time between designing the UI and building the app on Android Studio. In addition to that, I learnt how to work with limited time constraints and give our best amidst pressure.

**What's next for Sleep Detector :**
I wish to add a few more features like GPS to track the car, making calls to some others if the driver is too drowsy to drive. The most precious feeling to a person is the safety of their family. And we tried to ensure that by making amazing predictions about a person's level of drowsiness. Fewer accidents and more happiness to you all!
